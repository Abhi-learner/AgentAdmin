Subject:  Urgent Alert: Database Server Issue

Hello Team,

We detected a critical issue on server linux01. The database service failed to restart after the scheduled patch update.
This triggered an alert in our monitoring system.

A ticket has been automatically created: INC456789.

Additionally, we noticed that web03 experienced high CPU usage during the same window.
Please investigate and provide an update.

Regards,
Operations Team
