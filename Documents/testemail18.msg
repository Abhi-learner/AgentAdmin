Subject: High CPU usage on linux3 during nightly batch job

Body:
Hello Team,

During the last nightly batch process, the system linux3 reached 95% CPU utilization for more than 20 minutes. This triggered an alert in the monitoring system.

Additionally, users have reported that several scheduled jobs failed to complete on time. Please investigate the issue and confirm whether a restart of the batch service is required.

A new incident has been logged: INC56789. Kindly update the ticket once action is taken.

Thanks,
Operations Monitoring
