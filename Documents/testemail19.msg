Subject: Database connection failures detected on linux5

Body:
Hi Team,

We are observing repeated database connection failures on linux5 since 02:15 AM. Several application components are unable to connect, which might impact customer transactions.

Please analyze the root cause and advise if we need to restart the database listener or escalate to the vendor.

A work order WO77891 has been created to track this issue.

Regards,
DB Monitoring
