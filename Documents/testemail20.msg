Subject: Request to restart payment service on linux3

Body:
Hi Ops Team,

We are experiencing intermittent failures in the payment processing service. To mitigate the issue, please restart the payment service on linux3 during the next available window.

If the issue persists after restart, kindly create an incident ticket for deeper analysis.

Thanks,
Application Support
