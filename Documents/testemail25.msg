Subject: URGENT: Password Reset Needed for Production Account
Date: Wed, 27 Aug 2025 11:43:12 +0530

Hi Team,

I am unable to log in to linux1 server account (user: jdoe-prod).
It says the password has expired.  
Can you please reset my password urgently so that I can continue working?

This is impacting my ability to deploy a critical patch today.  

Thanks,
