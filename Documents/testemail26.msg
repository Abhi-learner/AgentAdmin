Subject: Request to Restore Database Backup (Production)
Date: Wed, 27 Aug 2025 14:25:08 +0530

Hello Team,

We need to restore the database backup for Production system `linux1` from yesterday (26th Aug 2025).  
The data was corrupted after a failed batch job run.  

Please restore the backup and confirm once it is completed.  
This is a high-priority task for the Finance team.

Regards,  
Anita Sharma
