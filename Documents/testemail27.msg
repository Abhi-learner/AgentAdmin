Subject: Request to Restore Database Backup on PROD-DB-01
Date: Thu, 28 Aug 2025 10:30:12 +0530

Hello Team,

Our finance application on the Production server PROD-DB-01 has become corrupted after last nightâ€™s batch process.  
We urgently need the database restored from the backup taken on 27th Aug 2025.

Please restore the backup and update us once the system is back online.  
This is a critical request, and I have logged Ticket INC12345 for tracking.

Thanks,  
Ravi Mehta
