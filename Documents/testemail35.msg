Subject: Request to Extend Filesystem on linux2

Body:

Hi Team,

We are running into frequent “disk full” issues on the linux2 server.
Could you please extend the /home filesystem by 30GB to ensure smooth execution of our test workloads?

Server: linux2

Environment: Test

Action Requested: Filesystem Extension

Ticket ID: INC445566

This is a Test environment, so no downtime impact on production.

Thanks,
Application Support Team
