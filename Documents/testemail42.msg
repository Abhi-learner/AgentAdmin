Subject: Request to Extend Filesystem on Server linux2

Hi Team,

We are running out of space on the /data filesystem of server linux2.  
Please extend the filesystem by an additional 100GB to accommodate upcoming workloads.  

Change ticket INC123456 has been raised for this activity.  
Kindly prioritize this request.  

Thanks,
