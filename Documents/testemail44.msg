Subject: Request for Filesystem Extension on Server app-finance-01

Hi Infra Team,

We are experiencing frequent space shortages on the /finance filesystem of server app-finance-01.  
Kindly extend the filesystem by 200GB to accommodate upcoming reporting workloads.  

A change ticket INC445566 has been raised for this request.  
Please process the extension as per standard procedure.

Regards,  
Finance Applications Team
