Subject: Disk Space Alert - linux2 /var at 94%

Hello Team,

We noticed that the /var filesystem on server linux2 has reached 94% utilization. 
A ticket INC998877 has already been created for tracking.

Additionally, please extend the filesystem by 20GB as this is a recurring issue.

Thanks,
Ops Monitoring
