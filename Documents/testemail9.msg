Subject: Task: Setup New Employee Workstation

Hello IT Team,

We have a new employee, Jane Smith, starting next Monday. Please prepare a workstation with the following requirements:

- Laptop with company standard image installed  
- Email account and calendar setup  
- Access to internal HR and Finance applications  
- VPN and remote access configured

Please confirm once the setup is complete so that Jane can start on her first day without any issues.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
HR Department
